<p>know about the life style of Vinayaka Damodar Savarkar</p>
</div>
<p>Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, also referred to as Veer Savarkar, was a writer, activist, and politician in India. While detained at Ratnagiri in 1922, Savarkar created the Hindu nationalist political theory known as Hindutva. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar held a position of prominence in the Hindu Mahasabha. When he authored his autobiography, he started adopting the honorific prefix Veer, which means “brave.”
Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was born on May 28, 1883 in the Marathi Chitpavan Brahmin Hindu household of Damodar and Radhabai Savarkar in the village of Bhagur, close to the city of Nashik, Maharashtra. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar also had a sister named Maina and two additional siblings named Ganesh and Narayan.
<br>Savarkar’s residence in Dadar, Bombay, was stoned by enraged mobs following Gandhi’s murder. Savarkar was detained by the government for giving “Hindu nationalist lectures” after being cleared of the charges relating to Gandhi’s killing and released from jail; he was eventually freed in exchange for giving up his political activity. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar went on to discuss Hindutva’s social and cultural components.</br></p>
